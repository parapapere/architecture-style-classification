# Project Overview

This project employs transfer learning with the ResNet50 model to identify architectural styles in building images. After training the model on a diverse dataset covering various architectural styles, a web application was developed for easy utilization of this tool.

# Features
- Transfer Learning with ResNet50: Utilizes pre-trained ResNet50 model for architectural style recognition. The whole code for machine learning process is described in notebook ***neural_network_for_architecture_style.ipynb*** 

- Web Application with FastAPI and Vue.js: Interactive web app to upload images and identify architectural styles with a single button press. The code for web aplication is under ***services*** folder
